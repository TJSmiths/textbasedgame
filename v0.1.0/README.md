Text based game made as a side project during Python Fundamentals

Todo:

- Make attack power based off 2 main stats
- Items can be found and add to total attack power meaning I can introduce stat requirements into the game without having to do individual maps per character
- Make 30 rooms for variation, boss is in the 10th room
- Consider making rooms as image assets to load once you have started the game
- Create events in the rooms that can influence attack power, then do some maths in the boss room to see if your health goes below 0 and if it does, lose game
